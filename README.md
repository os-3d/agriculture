# Open Source Agriculture
The scope of this work is defined as:

1. Lighting Control
2. Growth Medium Control
3. Water Management
4. Mineral/Nutrient Management

This project touches on 3 of the fourteen NAE engineering grand challenges:

1. Manage the Nitrogen Cycle - To restore balance to the nitrogen cycle with better fertilization technologies and by capturing and recycling waste.
2. Develop Carbon Sequestration Methods - Working on ways to capture and store excess carbon dioxide to prevent global warming.
3. Engineer the Tools of Scientific Discovery - Continue to be partners with scientists in the great quest for understanding many unanswered questions of nature.

Taking this a step further, the primary goals of this project are: to enable direct research into the optimization of food-production systems, and to take the tools and information that are devleoped and put it in the hands of anyone who wants it.

Included are the object primitives and/or gcode files to support independent research into agricultural best practices.
