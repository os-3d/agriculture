# Chip Light 1.0

# Disclosure
1. Potential (severe) burn risk.
2. Potential (severe, life threatening) electrical shock risk from working with electrical outlet level voltage/amps.

*Note: Exercise all appropriate caution when designing/building/using hot objects (electrical or otherwise). 

# Features
1. Passive Cooling
2. Light Diffusing
3. Quick Connect System

# Additional Items List
1. 50W Full Spectrum LED COB with integrated 120v AC to DC controller 
2. Aluminium heatsink 150mm (L) x 70mm (W) x10mm (H)
3. COB LED lens, 90 degree, size: 75x40mm
4. 125v 10A switch
5. 16 AWG solid-core wire
6. Waterproof electrical connector, 16 AWG 3 pin
7. Silicon adhesive
8. Insulated crimp terminals

# Results
1. Testing of the heatsink center and boundary temperature was conducted hourly for a period of 12 straight hours. After ramp up, the temperature gradient was consistent over this time and ranged from 120 degrees C (center) to 110 degrees C (boundary). The extrude temperature of PLA+ is 190 degrees C to 230 degrees C, so this is well within the material threshold to minimize fire risk, though it does present a potential (severe) burn risk given the heatsink is exposed.
2. Light output and coverage is more than sufficient for (many) single-plant growth needs at a range of distances.

# Next Steps
1. Design a solution that covers the heatsink.
